      "recommendedSubtasks": 2,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand the 'Design Top Bar' subtask to include detailed designs for breadcrumbs, collaborator avatars, and each action button (lock, history, comments, share, export). Also, create a subtask for integrating React Flow into the canvas area.",
      "reasoning": "The task involves multiple UI components and responsiveness considerations. While some subtasks are already defined, further breakdown of the top bar design and React Flow integration would be beneficial."

      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand the 'Implement User Management UI' subtask to include subtasks for adding, editing, and deleting users. Expand the 'Implement Role Creation Form' subtask to include subtasks for defining permissions and associating them with roles. Add a subtask for implementing data persistence for settings changes.",
      "reasoning": "The settings dialog involves complex UI elements and data management. The user management and role creation aspects require further decomposition. Data persistence is also a key aspect that needs its own subtask."

      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 2,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand the 'Implement Team Creation API Endpoint' subtask to include subtasks for input validation and error handling. Create a subtask for implementing authentication and authorization checks for the API endpoint.",
      "reasoning": "The team creation flow involves both UI and API development. The API endpoint requires more detailed subtasks for validation, error handling, and security."

      "recommendedSubtasks": 2,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand the 'Implement Project Creation API Endpoint' subtask to include subtasks for data validation, database interaction, and error handling. Create a subtask for implementing authentication and authorization checks for the API endpoint.",
      "reasoning": "Similar to team creation, the project creation flow requires more detailed subtasks for the API endpoint, focusing on validation, database interaction, and security."

      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand the 'Define RBAC Roles and Permissions' subtask to include subtasks for defining permissions for each resource type (organizations, teams, projects, workflows) and documenting these roles and permissions. Expand the 'Implement `hasPermission` Function' subtask to include subtasks for handling different user roles and resource permissions. Add a subtask for testing the access control middleware with different user roles and resource types.",
      "reasoning": "Access control enforcement is a complex task that requires careful planning and implementation. The RBAC definition and `hasPermission` function require further breakdown, and thorough testing is crucial."

      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand the 'Implement API Endpoint for Sending Invitation Emails' subtask to include subtasks for generating a unique token, storing invitation details in the database, and sending the email. Expand the 'Implement Invitation Acceptance Handler' subtask to include subtasks for verifying the token, creating a new user account (if necessary), and adding the user to the organization/team/project. Add a subtask for handling edge cases like expired or invalid tokens.",
      "reasoning": "The invitation flow involves multiple steps and requires careful handling of tokens, user accounts, and database updates. Further breakdown of the API endpoint and acceptance handler is necessary."

      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 2,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand the 'Implement API Endpoint for Transpilation' subtask to include subtasks for handling POST requests, validating JSON, and communicating with the transpiler. Expand the 'Display Generated Python Code' subtask to include subtasks for creating a dialog, displaying multi-line text, and providing a copy-to-clipboard option.",
      "reasoning": "Integrating the transpiler backend involves API communication and UI display. The API endpoint and code display require further decomposition for clarity."

Expand the 'Implement Audit Log Retrieval and Pagination' subtask to include subtasks for implementing database queries with LIMIT and OFFSET clauses and handling invalid page numbers or page sizes.",
      "reasoning": "The audit page requires careful design of the database schema and API endpoint to handle large datasets and complex queries. Further breakdown of these aspects is necessary."

Expand 'Integrate Payment Gateway' to include subtasks for secure storage, successful payments, and failed payments. Expand 'Implement Core Billing Logic and Invoice Generation' to include subtasks for different subscription plans, user seat counts, and billing cycles. Add a subtask for implementing role-based access control for billing management features.",
      "reasoning": "Billing management is a highly complex task with numerous components and scenarios to consider. Breaking down the UI, payment gateway integration, and billing logic into smaller subtasks will improve manageability and clarity. Security is also paramount and requires a dedicated subtask."

Expand 'UI Component Development for Plugin Management' to include subtasks for plugin search, displaying installed plugins, and handling installation/uninstallation actions. Add a subtask for implementing logging and auditing of plugin installation/uninstallation events.",
      "reasoning": "Plugin installation involves complex interactions between the UI, API, and database. The API endpoint and UI component require further decomposition for clarity and manageability. Logging and auditing are also important for tracking plugin usage and troubleshooting issues."

      "expansionPrompt": "Expand 'Implement Drag Source for Plugin Nodes' to include subtasks for configuring the drag source and carrying plugin node data. Expand 'Configure Canvas as Drop Target' to include subtasks for defining drop target behavior and extracting plugin node data. Expand 'Create and Render New Node on Drop' to include subtasks for retrieving the React component and instantiating it with configuration data. Add a subtask for implementing visual feedback during the drag-and-drop operation (e.g., a ghost image of the node).",
      "reasoning": "Drag-and-drop functionality requires careful coordination between the drag source, drop target, and React Flow canvas. Breaking down the drag source, drop target, and node creation processes into smaller subtasks will improve clarity and manageability. Visual feedback is also important for providing a good user experience."
