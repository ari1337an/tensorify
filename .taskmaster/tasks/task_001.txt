# Title: Initialize Next.js Project with Core Dependencies
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the Next.js project with React Flow, Tailwind UI, Shadcn UI, Zustand, Prisma ORM, PostgreSQL, and Clerk authentication. Configure the basic project structure, install dependencies, and initialize Clerk for user authentication.
# Details:
1. Create a new Next.js project using `create-next-app`.
2. Install React Flow, Tailwind UI, Shadcn UI, Zustand, Prisma, and Clerk.
3. Configure Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI.
4. Set up Prisma with PostgreSQL.
5. Initialize Clerk for user authentication, but disable Clerk's organization signup feature.
6. Create basic folder structure (components, pages, utils, api).

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify that the Next.js application starts without errors.
2. Ensure that all dependencies are installed correctly.
3. Check that Clerk authentication is initialized and working.
4. Confirm that Prisma can connect to the PostgreSQL database.
