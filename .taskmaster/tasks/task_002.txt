# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Main Application Layout
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1

# Description: Implement the main application layout with a collapsible sidebar, top bar, and an empty React Flow canvas. Ensure the layout is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
# Details:
1. Create a `Layout` component that includes the sidebar, top bar, and canvas area.
2. Implement the collapsible sidebar using Tailwind CSS and React state.
3. Design the top bar with breadcrumbs, collaborator avatars, and action buttons (lock, history, comments, share, export).
4. Integrate React Flow for the canvas area.
5. Ensure the layout is responsive using Tailwind CSS's responsive utilities.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify that the layout is displayed correctly on different screen sizes.
