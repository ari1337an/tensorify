1. To run a specific test file: "pnpm run test:args -- src/app/api/v1/\_contracts/[groupName]/[fileName].test.ts"
2. After creating an API endpoint file, you have to run "pnpm run generate:tsrest && pnpm run generate:tsrest:client" and do not ever edit manualy in the [index.ts](mdc:src/app/api/v1/_contracts/index.ts) and [client.ts](mdc:src/app/api/v1/_client/client.ts) ever as these two commands will generate them programatically and correctly than your dumbass.
3. **IMPORTANT**: If none of the tests are passing then you forgot to run the "pnpm run generate:tsrest && pnpm run generate:tsrest:client".
