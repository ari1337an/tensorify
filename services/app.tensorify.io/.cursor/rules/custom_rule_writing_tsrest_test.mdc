Sample Good TS-REST Test files are [onboardingSetup.test.ts](mdc:src/app/api/v1/_contracts/onboarding/onboardingSetup.test.ts) [onboardingQuestions.test.ts](mdc:src/app/api/v1/_contracts/onboarding/onboardingQuestions.test.ts) [getRoles.test.ts](mdc:src/app/api/v1/_contracts/roles/getRoles.test.ts)  [postRoles.test.ts](mdc:src/app/api/v1/_contracts/roles/postRoles.test.ts) [patchRole.test.ts](mdc:src/app/api/v1/_contracts/roles/patchRole.test.ts) (While you are in thinking stage, analyze these good test files to learn how to write tests for this project in what way to be consistent with the project)

You have to write tests with using [test-utils.ts](mdc:src/app/api/v1/_contracts/test-utils.ts) in such a way that main functionality and edge cases are covered which includes but not limited to:
1. Authentication Guard Check 
2. Invalid Request that doesn't follow the schema 
3. Edge cases that might break in real time and in some attacks (this is important for security reasons)

Now, write tests in with file name [filename].test.ts for [filename].ts in the same directory of that [filename].ts. 

You cannot ever run the whole test suite of the project, just check if your tests are correct by running this command: """npm run test:args -- src/app/api/v1/_contracts/[groupName]/[filename].test.ts""" for the tests of src/app/api/v1/_contracts/[groupName]/[filename].ts file.

you cannot edit [auth-utils.ts](mdc:src/app/api/v1/_contracts/auth-utils.ts) or [test-utils.ts](mdc:src/app/api/v1/_contracts/test-utils.ts)
