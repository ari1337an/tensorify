# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Workflow Creation Flow
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the workflow creation flow, allowing users to create new workflows within a project. Store the workflow information in the database.
# Details:
1. Create a UI component for creating workflows.
2. Implement an API endpoint to handle the workflow creation request.
3. Store the workflow information in the database.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify that the workflow creation UI is displayed correctly.
2. Check that the workflow is created successfully.
3. Ensure that the workflow information is stored in the database.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Workflow Creation UI Component [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design the user interface component for creating new workflows, including input fields for workflow name, description, and initial configuration options.
### Details:
Consider using a form with appropriate validation and user-friendly input controls. Research existing UI libraries for suitable components.

## 2. Implement API Endpoint for Workflow Creation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the API endpoint to receive and process workflow creation requests from the UI. This includes request validation and data transformation.
### Details:
Use a RESTful API design. Implement proper error handling and logging. Ensure the endpoint is secured with appropriate authentication and authorization mechanisms.

## 3. Define Workflow Database Schema [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the database schema for storing workflow information, including fields for workflow ID, name, description, creation date, and configuration details.
### Details:
Choose appropriate data types for each field. Consider using a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) or a NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB) based on the project requirements. Define indexes for efficient querying.

## 4. Implement Workflow Data Persistence [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2, 8.3
### Description: Implement the logic to store the workflow information received from the API endpoint into the database, using the defined schema.
### Details:
Use an ORM (e.g., Hibernate, SQLAlchemy) or a database access library to interact with the database. Implement proper transaction management to ensure data consistency.

## 5. Integrate UI Component with API Endpoint [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2, 8.4
### Description: Connect the workflow creation UI component to the API endpoint, allowing users to submit workflow creation requests and receive feedback.
### Details:
Use asynchronous communication (e.g., AJAX, Fetch API) to send requests to the API endpoint. Display appropriate feedback to the user based on the API response (e.g., success message, error message).
